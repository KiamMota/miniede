# miniEDE
A lightweight and efficient terminal-based code editor for C/C++.

## What is miniEDE?

**miniEDE** was conceived as a simple, yet powerful, code editor designed specifically for C/C++ development, inspired by the MS-DOS command-line interface. Initially, the project was named **TurboDOS** to reference DOS, but as the project evolved, the first version was released under the name **nanoEDE**.

However, to avoid confusion with the popular **nano** editor in Bash, the project was renamed to **miniEDE** â€” preserving the essence of the original idea while clearly distinguishing it from other tools.

miniEDE utilizes a **manual event system**, with specialized modules that handle keyboard and mouse events. This design reflects the natural evolution of the project, enabling highly customizable and responsive user interaction.

In addition, miniEDE features a **simple and intuitive menu**, allowing for easy navigation and efficient workflow without overwhelming the user interface.

The core philosophy of miniEDE is **extreme efficiency**, focusing on performance and simplicity. This ensures that developers can concentrate on coding, without unnecessary distractions or slowdowns.
